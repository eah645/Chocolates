    <tr>
      <th>Chocolate is an extremely common food. Despite being common and known by many, the process of making it is complex. It involves harvesting cocoa, refining cocoa to cocoa beans, and shipping the completed cocoa beans out to a manufacturing factory to be transformed into different types of chocolate.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b><u>Step 1: Plucking and opening pods</b></u> <br>
      Cocoa beans grow in pods that sprout off Tropical Evergreen Cocoa Trees (ex: Theobroma Cocoa). They are typically the size of a football. Pods start off green and turn orange once they are ripe. Harvesters travel through cocoa orchards and remove the pods gently from trees. <br>
      After cocoa pods are collected, they are taken to a processing house. The pods are then split open and the cocoa beans inside are removed. Every pod has around 50 cocoa beans. Fresh cocoa beans are not brown, and do not taste like the chocolate they will produce.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b><u>Step 2: Fermenting the cocoa seeds</b></u> <br>
      Cocoa beans go through fermentation processing. They are placed in either large, shallow, heated trays or covered with large banana leaves. If the climate is right, they may be heated by the sun. Workers periodically stir them so that all beans are equally fermented. The beans turn brown during this process. This process may take five - eight days.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b><u>Step 3: Drying the cocoa seeds</b></u> <br>
      Cocoa seeds need to be died before being shipped to chocolate manufacturers. Harvesters spread the fermented seeds on trays and leave them in the sun to dry. The process usually takes a week and seeds become half their original weight.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b><u>Step 4: Roasting and winnowing cocoa</b></u> <br>
        Once cocoa seeds have reached chocolate manufacturers, the seeds are roasted. It develops the color and flavor of the cocoa beans into chocolate. The outer shell of the beans are removed, and the inner cocoa bean is broken into small pieces known as "cocoa nibs." <br>
        The roasting process makes cocoa shells brittle. Cocoa nibs pass through sieves, which strain and sort the nibs according to size (known as winnowing).

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b><u>Step 5: Grinding the cocoa nibs</b></u> <br>
      Grinding turns cocoa nibs into "cocoa liquor," known as unsweetened chocolate or cocoa mass. The process generates heat and changes the cocoa nib into a liquid. The cocoa liquor is then mixed with cocoa butter and sugar.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b><u>Step 6: Blending cocoa liruor and molding chocolate</b></u> <br>
      After being mixed, the blend is refined. The cocoa powder is blended back with butter and liquor in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate. <br>
      After blending, molding is the final procedure. It allows for chocolate to cool and harden into different shapes. Those shapes of chocolate are packaged and distributed.
